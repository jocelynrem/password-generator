https://jocelynrem.github.io/password-generator/

## The Application

This application enables users to generate random passwords based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.


## How it Works

Users press the 'Generate Password' button and are guided through several prompts:
1. How many characters do you want your passwod to be? Enter a number 8-128?
    The user must enter a valid number

2. Do you want to include lowercase letters in your password?
    The user must choose 'ok' for yes or 'cancel' for no.

3. Do you want to include uppercase letters in your password?
    The user must choose 'ok' for yes or 'cancel' for no.

4. Do you want to include numbers in your password?
    The user must choose 'ok' for yes or 'cancel' for no.

5. Do you want to include special characters in your password?
    The user must choose 'ok' for yes or 'cancel' for no.

NOTE: The user must choose a valid password length AND say 'ok' to at least one set of criteria or an error alert will appear.
